            <h3>Create cutting edge stuff</h3>

          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Solve complex problems</h3>

              <p>
                &ldquo;You accomplished a lot and have pushed (and pulled) the company further along on its path to being a global, world class company. A list of some of your accomplishments:

          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="acronymlist">

            <h3>Have an impact</h3>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                &ldquo;I think you have had a major impact on the business, especially since moving into the Customer Experience Manager role:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Short term gains - change management success and performance improvements especially in the operations team.</li>
                <li>Long term gains - the move to a performance culture that is centered around learning and development and has given us a new found backbone to the organisation.&rdquo;</li>

            <h3>Take calculated risks</h3>
            <blockquote>
              &ldquo;You face a lot of challenges in 2015. Stepping in to a management role, managing existing staff with existing problems, and having to motivate and deal with a variety of tasks will be a stiff challenge.&rdquo;
            </blockquote>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Mentor others</h3>

            <h3>Learn from failures</h3>
            <blockquote>
              &ldquo;I appreciate your honest assessment at your short-comings this year. As you mention they were on the soft skills: inadequate levels of communication and emotional maturity at the executive level. For you to truly be effective and grow in the future these need to develop much further. But you have taken the first steps by openly admitting your faults, taking on feedback, and being open to development.&rdquo;
